NOTE: Sorry for not complete this test project;
      My Time was over, so, I can make it clean;
      And I hope you want to consider me first;
      Because I learn this Java Programming in just 1 week;
      I must overthink to code it;

      So, I'm coding from Javascript first, then I convert it to Java Language.

      It supposed to be when you start the Application;
      You must to input your Planet language with Romawi Number;
      then, you must to input your Credits;
      then, you can ask it;

      but, my time is over to make it like this.
      so.. Once again, I hope you want to consider me first;
      thank you;
